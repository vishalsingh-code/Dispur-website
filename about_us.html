<p> 
Dear Students Welcome to a new world of opportunities. Opportunities, which coupled with your purpose, steadfastness and tenacity, will help you take your first steps into unknown waters and create ripple effects which have the potential to change the world. We, at Dispur College are here to provide you these opportunities and endeavour towards your holistic growth. We believe not only in the immediate aim of producing bright, knowledgeable and inspired students to be the society’s future torchbearers, but also in the long term goal of creating and spreading awareness of the tremendous potential of information technology and its social contribution, thus facilitating a seamless transition from one’s comfort zone to the unfamiliar wide world beyond. Dispur College is among the first batch of provincialized colleges and the first college in Guwahati to provide WiF i facilities in the campus. This, we believe will go a long way in keeping one’ s finger on the pulse of the ever changing world, and move forward in tandem with the times. Maintenance of discipline in all aspects of campus life is strictly adhered to here in Dispur College. We believe that after your stint in the college, you will be equipped to cope with that delicate balance of freedom and duty which the adult world involves, to learn how to lead and inspire, through example and high standards. Dispur College has been constantly striving towards this end ever since its inception. We spare no effort to enhance the latent qualities within you, to explore inter-disciplinary understanding and develop a capacity for critical evaluation of real life situations. Dispur College is a frontrunner in providing campus recruitment exercise. This is a quantum leap towards gainful placement of students after, or in some cases, even before graduation. We, here at Dispur College, are always open to fresh and constructive suggestions and ideas from the new generation, anything that would help to make the world a better place to live in. Since the last 30 years, we have left no stone unturned to provide our students with modem education, combining the latest global trends and techniques along with the age-old, rich, cultural heritage of India. May yours be a bright future.
